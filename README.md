# Heart-Failure-Prediction-using-Decision-Tree-ML-
Predict the presence or absence of heart disease using patient data, employing machine learning models for classification. This project utilizes features like age, gender, chest pain type, blood pressure, and more to make accurate predictions, helping in early detection and prevention.

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various medical and lifestyle features. Using machine learning algorithms, the model classifies whether a patient is at risk for heart disease. Key features include age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart rate, and more.

The goal is to provide healthcare professionals with an early warning system to aid in diagnosing heart disease and recommending preventive measures. This project leverages well-known classification models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to make accurate predictions.

Features:
Data Input: Age, gender, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting ECG, maximum heart rate, exercise-induced angina, oldpeak, slope, number of major vessels.
Model Output: A classification result indicating the presence or absence of heart disease.
Evaluation: Models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure robustness.
This repository provides a comprehensive approach to heart disease prediction, from data preprocessing to model evaluation. It's an excellent resource for healthcare professionals, researchers, or anyone interested in health-related machine learning applications.

Technologies Used:
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Numpy
Gradio (for the interactive GUI)
